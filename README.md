INTRODUCTION

Mechatronics project aims to design and develop Electromechanical systems that combined with electrical, mechanical and computer engineering applications. The obstacle detector for blind person project seeks to address the problem of blind persons having trouble navigating new situations. The concept employs ultrasonic sensors to identify obstructions in a person's route and warn them via an vibration output method.

The system consists of an ultrasonic sensor that sends out sound waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back from an obstacle.  The system can determine how far the obstacle is from the sensor using this information.  The device sends out an audible signal to the user to let them know there is an impediment present if one is found within a predetermined range. The obstacle detector mounted on a wearable device. 

By offering a dependable and cost-effective solution for obstacle detection, Ultrasonic obstacle detectors for blinds project seeks to improve the mobility and freedom of persons with visual impairments.

The system consists with two sub systems
1. Manual system - Manual system code
2. Automatic system - Automatic system code



METHODOLOGY

Method of power up the system separately using manual switches. 
Method of  switching the system using a switch such as manual system and auto system
Method of detecting the height of the sensors to the flow level using  a manual push button.
Method of detecting obstacles through several angles.
Method of detecting the obstacle and pits by using ultrasonic sensors for some several angles.
Method of detecting the rough area of the obstacle or pits and the distance to them.
Method of analyzing the sensors that would detected the obstacles and the distance level and control it for the particular vibrators.
Method of activating the vibrators until missed up the obstacle or pits.
Method of looping above steps until switched off the system 



USER INSTRUCTION

Instruction before manipulation the systems
1.Firstly wear the chest cover and the hand glove properly. Make sure the chest cover system is in vertical. 
2.Then power up the both systems by turning on the power buttons.
3.Then make sure you are in a flat and clear area with no obstructions within a rough range of 2 meters from your feet.
4.Then switch the system into auto mode by turning on the system change button in the manual system (On the glove).
5.Then press the height button until all the five vibrators worked for a instant. (If the five vibrators are activated for a instant, it means your height is stored to the system.)
6.Then you can navigates until you met with an obstacle.
7.According to the above indicating figures you can identify the obstacles and pits with the distance level.
8.The vibration intensity can be increased or decrease using vibration level changer.
9. Then switch the system to the manual mode such an indication from the automatic system.
10. Then moving your hand you can have an imaginary rough sketch of the obstacles.
11.You can switches the systems as you wish to detect obstacles when you navigates. 
12.Turn off both systems when not needed.



SUGGESTIONS

1.Both systems can be miniaturized by using a proper IC instead of an aurduino uno board with lithium iron batteries.
2.Instead of using ultrasonic sensors IR array can be used to detect obstacles very accurately. In this case five IR arrays needed to the 4 distance levels and to the manual system . So it will be expensive when making a such system.
3.The detection area can be increased using more sensors but then the indication level will be complex, because the angle should be indicate such a scenario to have effective detection.
4.Also vibration intensity levels can be defined to indicate in this system or the system above mentioned. Also then the complexity of the system increases.
5.This indication method with different vibration  intensity levels can be used to implement, complex combined indications to increased the blind peoples figure with the help of machine learning and image processing system.
6.A rotating ultrasonic sensor can be used with defined angles can be used to detect obstacle instead of five level sensor arrays.



CONCLUSTON
 
The project was successfully completed with in the time period given. Blind people can overcome their difficulties through a such improved system when they navigates and the doing there daily works. It was a new experince and also a great opportunity to improved our knowledge with mechatronic system. The guidelines and the instructions that the Sayuru sir and instructors were given, very helpful to succeed the project in the way we done.
